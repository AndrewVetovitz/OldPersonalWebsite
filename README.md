# My Website Overall
Made specifically to show case personal projects as well as individual skills and information to future employers. Overall happy with the results and now willing to invest more time into web based projects if the opportunities present themselves.

# Working on the project
Personal website created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Bootstrap Framework used as well as Jquery for both mobile and overall website responsivness.

Total website backend took about 1 week total. To create the front end as well as all the custom picutres and color matching took around 2-3 days in total. Overall I am happy with the project results. Not personally into making web applications, but I liked doing this project far more than I origionally thought I would.

# Future Work
Looking to update my website in the future to maybe add a blog or to add more funcionality in terms of javaScript to make the website interatice. As I update my resume and build more project I will add them to the website, but otherwise this requires no major changes in the code base as time goes on.
